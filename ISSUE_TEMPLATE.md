I'm no longer maintaining this package. It doesn't reliably work on all bundles and it isn't worth my time to debug each issue and try to implment a patch to handle your specific bundle 

That being said, there is osme excellent documentation here: https://github.com/1egoman/debundle/blob/master/DOCS.md. Also, the code is well commented, and there's logging littered throughout. If you're unfamiliar with javascript AST, you should probably read about that a bit first before diving in.

Also, I have a work in progress project that builds on top of the lessons I've learned on this project. I plan for this to be a toolkit (ie, lots of functions that operate on bundles) of some sort. It'll be ready when it's ready, so don't ask me if I'm done with it yet.
